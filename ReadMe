Hello there, after cloning this i think it wont show 'inceptionv3' model because that is very big size of inceptionv3 model 
class so please download this by your own.

developer.apple.com/machine-learning (Source to download the models of machine learning)

I used here inception model to recognize real object you can use by your choice like: resNet50, SqueezeNet, Places205-GoogLeNet and many more availables

And make sure to change the 'model' type to selected model you download in viewcontroller class.
